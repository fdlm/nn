# nn - tools for training Lasagne neural networks

This is a collection of tools that facilitate training
[Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne) neural networks. These tools
are specifically tailored for my needs and might thus not be generally
applicable.

You might want to look at the following repositories:

 - [dmgr](https://github.com/fdlm/dmgr): Data handling utilities for training
   [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne) neural networks.
 - [chordrec](https://github.com/fdlm/chordrec): My experimental framework
   to train neural network-based models for chord recognition. This is the
   actual reason why the dmgr and nn libraries exist.
